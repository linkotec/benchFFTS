FFTS -- The Fastest Fourier Transform in the South
by Anthony Blake <anthonix@me.com>

To build for Android, edit and run build_android.sh

To build for iOS, edit and run build_iphone.sh 

To build for Linux or OS X on x86, run 
./configure --enable-sse --enable-single --prefix=/usr/local
make
make install

To build for Windows x64 with MSVC 2005 and YASM v1.3, run
  mkdir build
  cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 8 2005 Win64"
  
Note that 32 bit Windows is not supported at the moment.
  
FFTS dynamically generates code at runtime. This can be disabled with 
--disable-dynamic-code

For JNI targets: --enable-jni will build the jni stuff automatically for
the host target, and --enable-shared must also be added manually for it to
work.
